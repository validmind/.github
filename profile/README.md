# What is ValidMind?

The ValidMind platform is a suite of tools helping developers, data scientists and risk & compliance stakeholders identify potential risks in their AI and large language models (LLMs), and generate robust, high-quality model documentation that meets regulatory requirements.

The platform is adept at handling many use cases, including models compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers API, and GPT 3.5, GPT 4, and hosted LLama2 and Falcon-based models that are focused on text classification and text summarization use cases.

In addition to LLMs, ValidMind can also handle testing and documentation generation for a wide variety of models, including:

- Traditional machine learning models (ML), such as tree-based models and neural networks
- Natural language processing models (NLP)
- Traditional statistical models, such as OLS regression, logistic regression, time series, etc.
- And many more model types
